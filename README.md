This project is built based on the following steps: https://github.com/mjhea0/flaskr-tdd#bootstrap

## Pros of TDD
Some pros of test driven development are listed below:
- every developer working on the project is on the same page and has a full view of the expected functionality of the application
- bugs can be detected early as the developers are testing their code as they go and iterating accordingly
- it can be easier to debug as you know exactly what tests are failing (and therefore what functionality is breaking), especially when using unit tests

## Cons of TDD
Some cons of test driven development are listed below
- it can be slow as it is time consuming to write tests before implementing code
- this can have a high learning curve for new developers
- it can lead to over-testing where developers become too focused on writing tests for every little detail. this can be counterproductive
